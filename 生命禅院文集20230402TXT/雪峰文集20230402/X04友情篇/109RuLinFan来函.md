Dear ladies and gentlemen,

I found the series of your articles in June of this year. I have read around 100 of them. These topics are very interesting. I very much respect your points of view, and do agree with most of them. On the other hand, I have a few questions that I wish to discuss with you. And also, in my opinion, there might be some small mistakes in a few articles. I am looking forward to your response. Thank you!
