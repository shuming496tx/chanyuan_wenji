Walking on my way

浑沌草


I come from far away,

Bring the true news of life way,

Following my step night and day,

For I'll lead you to Heaven to stay.

The \<chanyuan girls are 18 years young\> I written today, 

There is a deep meaning inside of it lay,

All of you come from women's bay,

Must go back through it for a long life stay.

Change your value up side down,

Like a Grass hold earth tightly,

Wash chanyuan girls feet like washing baby,

Your heart will be pure and brightly.

Please walking on my way,

You'll know something in the future by day.

I'm crying my dear.
