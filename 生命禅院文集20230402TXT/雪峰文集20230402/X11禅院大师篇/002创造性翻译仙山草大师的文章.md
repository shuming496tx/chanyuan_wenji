创造性翻译仙山草大师的文章

浑沌草


沉睡的世界和清醒的人群

    All that I can say is, not only let them read but also make them feel, make them cry, make them understand what is going on out there. And how to save them is up to us. As God's survants, also as writers, we are responsible to interprate what Father wishes us to say to the children. Father only speaks the truth and the way how life should be but not some garbage left to be debated. Because of these complecated issuses left people stray away from our Father. Some people read these articles like a form of entertainment and they don't realize that we are trying to save them from sadness and suffering. When they read this, it means they have found the answer of life here. But to them, it is just another acticle about God. The next minute, they get on with their lives like yesterday.

    总而言之，我想要表达的是，不仅要让读着阅读文章表面的文采和知识，而且要使大家能切身感受文中的智慧和情感，要引起人们内心的强烈共鸣，要使大家知晓文章中所传达的信息，明白我们的世界上在发生着什么。如何拯救人类取决于我们这些上帝仆人的努力，我们有责任把上帝的意愿和启示书写出来奉献给上帝的子民。我们的天父上帝传达给我们的都是真知和如何按照其意愿享受人生的最佳途径，而不是留给人们当话柄去争吵争论的模棱两可的废话，因为恰恰是那些不明真相却固执己见的所谓知识和智慧将人们导入了歧途，使人们偏离了上帝的大道。许多人阅读禅院文章仅仅是当作饭后谈资或享受暂时休闲娱乐，根本没有意识到我们的本意是要率领他们脱离苦海，使他们不再遭受悲伤和苦难的折磨。当人们阅读禅院文章，意味着他们找到了生活的密码和生命的奥秘，非常遗憾的是，他们仅仅把这一篇篇文章看成了关于上帝之道的又一篇阐释，读完了，转身就忘，依旧活在过去的习惯思维和生活方式中。

    For example, I have been telling the person next to me not to drive like a mad man or don't do this , don't do that because the way you drive is very dangerous. This person did not know how serious it would be if he hit and kill someone. What if the person you killed in the accident was a father of two children or four children. Then, who is going to support the family, how will the children grow. Let me summerise this, these children will become your victom because of your stupidity. May be you don't care, if you really don't care, that's find because Father said, whoever have done wrong will be punished. The day when you go to jail will be the day you cry and remember what I have been trying to tell you.

    举例来说，我总是在提醒我身旁开车的人驾驶车辆一定要小心再小心，不能有丝毫的大意和疏忽，不能像疯子那样漫不经心地飞驰，因为这种驾驶方法危险异常。野蛮驾驶车辆的人没有清醒地意识到自己的行为是多么地严重，因为假如万一撞了人或压死了人后果则不堪设想，比如某位需要养育两个或四个依然幼年孩童的父亲在你野蛮驾驶导致的车祸中丧生，那么，谁去照料这个家庭？谁去抚养这些子女？让我告诉你，这个家庭和这些孩子是你愚蠢行为的受害者，或许你对此不在意，但若你内心无一点愧疚，等待你的将是如此结果——种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆，造孽报应，如影随形之上帝之道。有朝一日，当你迈入地狱大门之时，就是你哭天喊地且能想起我的教诲之期，不过，那时已经永远地悔之已晚了。

    The person I have just talked about is like most people out there. They are still sleeping and they don't even know it. I can try to wake them up but they always reply "Okay ! okay ! just a few more minutes". But in life, if you don't wake up now and change your daily routine and start to learn and practice what Lifechanyuen has to offer. You have already wasted a lot of time. And how long? When you still ask yourself "why am I still suffuring".

    我刚才提醒和教导的人实际上就是那些依然徘徊在生命禅院门外的人们，他们依然沉睡着，这个世界依然沉睡着，他们对如此重大的信息无动于衷，漠然置之，我努力想唤醒他们，但他们总是推诿说“好吧！好吧！我明天就按照你说的去做。”光阴荏苒，日月如梭，假若你不立刻警醒学习禅院理念，并将生命禅院理念付诸生活的方方面面，你就是在耗费时光。你要等待多久？难道天天问自己“我为什么依旧在承受磨难”却不想获得答案且摆脱逆境吗？

    I do not suffur any more because I have attained fruit and Father has taken away my pain. I am 33 years old and I have done it, now it is your turn. Father would be very happy if you all can start to learn and PRACTICE how to LOVE and have fun.

    我不再迷惘受苦，因为我拥有了丰富的果实，天父上帝解脱了我的一切苦难。我今年33岁，我依照禅院理念得道了，现在该轮到你了，如果你当下学习并实践爱和欢乐的法则，天父上帝将非常喜悦并来到你的身旁。

    If you enjoy your suffuring then go on sleeping like everyone else.

    如果你愿意受苦受难，那就继续像禅院外的人们那样醉生梦死沉睡吧！

    翻译说明：我是创造性地翻译了仙山草的话语，但我可以肯定的是，我是忠实地表达了仙山草带给我们的信息，题目是我加上去的，也基本符合事实，题目的含义是：禅院草们是清醒的人群，生命禅院墙外是沉睡的世界。

    本篇奠定了仙山草成为禅院大师的基础，建议将仙山草的名字列入《禅院大师榜》。
